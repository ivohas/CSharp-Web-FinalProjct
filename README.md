# CSharp-Web-FinalProjct
My final project for SoftUni-Web course will be here.
The project is made with C# ASP.NET Core Web App- Mvc on .Net 6.0 with authentication type- Individual accounts and it is configure for Https
The idea of the app is to find some books to read, based on reviews, ratings, price, popularity and etc.In the details page you can see everything about the book. You can add it for books which you want to read and when you read it you can rate it, write your comment about it and move it to read books. If you already know what books you want you can search it thouth the the search page. In search page you can search with the name of the author too or by category and you can choose how many books you can see in each page, because there will more than one page if your createries are not accurate. There is page for all the authors if you have something in your mind, you can check more in authors details where is button to see other books by him and something for him. In the Home page there is two of the most popular books and button to go to see other popular ones.
There will be between 15-25 views in the application, the controllers will be around 6-7, the admin will have one like the edit for the book or the author one. He has permition to add books and authors. The Administrator is going to have different area and layout from the normal user
Most of the code is going to be cover and check bg Unit testing
Most of teh views are responsive, as for the image in the Home page is SVG
For now images are saved in SSMS and wwwroot, but most likely be used some file storege clould
May be added Discusion chat with SingleR of users to comunicate between themselves.
Most likely the application will be hosted and link will be provided it the top of the ReadMe 
There is 3 error page for the different types of errors, and there is error handing in the controllers just in case something goes wrong.
There will be added securety so it can be prevented attacks and security vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, parameter tampering, AutoForgeryToken, etc.
May be added Web Api with AJAX request so the users can see how many people find books the want and how many books will be read, because of this site.
In the database is made though scafolding it in Microsoft SQL, there is entity for user, book, author, publisher, category and maping one between the user and book, wiil be added more.
